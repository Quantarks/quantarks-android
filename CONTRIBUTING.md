To contribute:

## Make your changes
**Via Terminal/Command Prompt**
1. Fork this repo.
  ![Fork this repo.](https://i.imgur.com/Z3QbByM.png)
  ![You will have a copy of the repository on your account](https://i.imgur.com/AlxR1xq.png)
1. Clone *your* repo.

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/[your username here]/quantarks-android.git
    ```

1. Import the project into Android Studio.
1. Do what you must. :smile: (Don't forget to commit: `git commit -m "Write here what changed"
1. Submit a pull request.

**Via Android Studio**
1. Again, fork this repo first so you have a copy on your own account.![Fork this repo.](https://i.imgur.com/Z3QbByM.png)
  
  ![Make sure you have forked the repository](https://i.imgur.com/zNRCQKH.png)
  ![Then copy the URL from your forked repo](https://i.imgur.com/QdHOF4h.png)
  
1. From inside Android Studio, choose *Check out from version control*, and then choose *GitHub*
  ![Choose the "Check out project from version control"](https://i.imgur.com/ExOY0nx.png)
  
1. Choose the directory where you want to save the project. And enter the URL of **your** GitHub repo, the one you forked, the one that's in your account. Then click *Clone*
  ![Remember to put your username in the URL, not "Quantarks"](https://i.imgur.com/AKqtG1M.png)
  Android Studio will then ask you if you would like to open the project. Click *Yes* (or something similar). The project will then start to build.

1. Before making changes, create a new branch. Name it however you want. The principle is for your changes not to mess up with the `master` branch, which is the "finished" product. You can create a new branch by clicking `VCS > Git > Branches... > New Branch` from the menu bar.

1. After making changes, from the menu bar, click `VCS > Git > Commit`.
1. After that, push your commits: `VCS > Git > Push` or Ctrl + K.

**Aaaanddd... you're done!** The maintainers will verify your work, and if it passes (which is very likely because you're awesome), it gets merged to the main branch.

Thanks for your help!
